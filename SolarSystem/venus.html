    <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is a terrestrial planet similar in size and mass to Earth, making it Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It has the densest atmosphere among terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with thick sulfuric acid clouds. Venus’s surface experiences extreme conditions, with a mean temperature of 464 °C (867 °F) and a pressure 92 times that of Earth’s, where carbon dioxide exists in a supercritical state. Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust but lacks an internal dynamo, resulting in a weakly induced magnetosphere. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, which resurfaces the planet instead of supporting plate tectonics. Venus has no moons and once may have had liquid water and a habitable environment before a runaway greenhouse effect transformed it. Venus rotates retrograde (opposite its orbital direction) and takes 224.7 Earth days to orbit the Sun. It is Earth’s closest orbital neighbor and an accessible target for interplanetary missions. Prominent in human culture as the "morning star" or "evening star," Venus is the third brightest object in Earth’s sky. Missions like Venera 7 revealed its harsh environment, influencing scientific predictions about global warming and dismissing earlier notions of Venus as habitable.</p>
