    <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Despite its size, it has less than a third the mass of Jupiter, and it is about 95 times more massive than Earth. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), taking 29.45 years to complete one orbit. Saturn's interior is thought to consist of a rocky core, surrounded by layers of metallic hydrogen, liquid hydrogen and helium, and a gaseous outer layer. Its pale yellow appearance is due to ammonia crystals in the upper atmosphere. Saturn's magnetic field, generated by currents in the metallic hydrogen layer, is weaker than Earth's but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach up to 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph). Saturn is famous for its bright, extensive ring system made primarily of ice particles, along with rocky debris and dust. The planet has at least 146 moons, 63 of which are named, not including the many moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere.</p>
