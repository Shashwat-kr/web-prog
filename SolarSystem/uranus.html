    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and an ice giant with a cyan color. It is primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase, which are considered volatiles or "ices" in astronomy. Its atmosphere has complex layered clouds and the lowest minimum temperature of any planet in the Solar System at 49 K. Uranus has an unusual axial tilt of 82.23Â°, causing its poles to experience 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness during its 84-Earth-year orbit. Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass in the Solar System. Its internal structure is believed to consist of a rocky core surrounded by a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The planet's atmosphere also contains trace hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Uranus exhibits unexplained weather phenomena, such as high wind speeds of up to 900 km/h and erratic cloud formations. It has very little internal heat compared to other giant planets, and the cause remains unclear. Uranus has a faint ring system, a magnetosphere, and 28 known moons, including five major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. The planet was first observed by William Herschel in 1781 and was later named after the Greek god Uranus. It has been visited by Voyager 2 in 1986, and there is a push to revisit Uranus through future missions.</p>
