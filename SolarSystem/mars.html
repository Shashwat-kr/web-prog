    <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known as the "Red Planet" due to its iron(III) oxide-rich surface, which gives it an orange-red appearance. It is the second smallest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). A Martian solar day, or sol, lasts 24.6 hours, and a Martian year is 1.88 Earth years (687 days). Mars has two small, irregularly shaped natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos. Mars features a stark contrast between its northern plains and southern highlands, a distinction known as the Martian dichotomy. The planet hosts geological marvels, including Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the Solar System at 21.9 km (13.6 mi), and Valles Marineris, a massive canyon system stretching 4,000 km (2,500 mi). Mars experiences temperature extremes from −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) to 5.7 °C (42.3 °F) and seasonal variations due to its axial tilt, similar to Earth. Its thin atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, and polar ice caps contain frozen CO₂. Mars formed 4.5 billion years ago and has undergone distinct geological eras: the Noachian period, characterized by meteor impacts and possible water oceans; the Hesperian period, marked by volcanic activity and massive floods; and the Amazonian period, dominated by wind-driven processes. These features make Mars a key target for investigating past or present life. Since the late 20th century, Mars has been extensively explored by spacecraft and rovers, starting with the Mariner 4 flyby in 1965, the Mars 2 orbiter in 1971, and the Viking 1 lander in 1976. As of 2023, 11 active probes are exploring Mars. While future human exploration of Mars is a priority, no such missions are planned for the 2020s.</p>
