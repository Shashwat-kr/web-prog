    <p >Mercury, the smallest planet in the Solar System and closest to the Sun, is named after the Roman god of commerce and communication. Classified as a terrestrial planet, it shares similarities with Earth’s Moon, including a heavily cratered surface formed by billions of years of impact events. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, spans 1,550 km, about a third of the planet’s diameter (4,880 km). Mercury also features thrust faults (rupes) and bright ray systems caused by past impacts. Mercury’s unique 3:2 spin-orbit resonance means it completes three rotations for every two orbits around the Sun. While its sidereal day is 58.65 Earth days, a solar day lasts 176 Earth days, leading to extreme temperature fluctuations. Equatorial temperatures range from −170 °C at night to 420 °C in sunlight, while the poles, with permanent shadows, may harbor water ice. With a thin exosphere and a faint magnetic field that deflects solar winds, Mercury lacks a natural satellite. Geologically, its homogeneous mantle suggests an early magma ocean. It likely has a silicate crust, solid and liquid core layers, and a solid inner core. Though formed 4.5 billion years ago, many aspects of Mercury's origins remain under study, with data from space probes continuing to shape our understanding.</p>
