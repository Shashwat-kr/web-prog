    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, known for its deep blue color and strong weather patterns. It is the densest of the gas giants and 17 times the mass of Earth, with a composition primarily of gases and liquids. Neptune has no well-defined solid surface and orbits the Sun every 164.8 years at a distance of 30.1 AU. It was the first planet discovered through mathematical predictions, following discrepancies in Uranus's orbit, and was observed in 1846. Neptune's atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives the planet its faint blue appearance. It has active weather patterns, including the Great Dark Spot observed during Voyager 2â€™s 1989 flyby. Neptune experiences the strongest sustained winds in the Solar System, reaching speeds of 2,100 km/h. Its outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures near 55 K. The planet has a faint and fragmented ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Neptune is challenging to study due to its great distance and dimness, but the Hubble Space Telescope and adaptive optics have provided more detailed observations. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.</p>
