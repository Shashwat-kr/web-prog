    <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known astronomical body to support life. It is an ocean world, with 70.8% of its surface covered by a global ocean and the remaining 29.2% as land, primarily in continental masses. Earth's dynamic atmosphere, composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, regulates surface conditions and protects against meteoroids and harmful UV radiation. Water vapor and greenhouse gases like CO₂ maintain an average surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), enabling liquid water and supporting a complex global climate system. The planet's crust is divided into tectonic plates that drive geological activity, creating mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Its liquid outer core generates a magnetosphere, shielding the surface from solar winds and cosmic radiation. Earth is the largest, most massive, and densest of the rocky planets, shaped into an ellipsoid with a circumference of 40,000 km. Earth rotates in 23 hours and 56 minutes and completes an orbit around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Its axial tilt causes seasons, and the Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, stabilizes its axis, causes tides, and slows its rotation. Formed 4.5 billion years ago, Earth became habitable within its first billion years. Human activity now significantly impacts Earth’s climate and ecosystems, threatening biodiversity and sustainability.</p>
