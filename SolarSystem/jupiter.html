    <p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest in the Solar System, with a mass over 2.5 times that of all other planets combined and nearly one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is 11 times that of Earth, and it orbits the Sun at 5.20 AU (778.5 million km) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. Jupiter is the third brightest object in Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since ancient times. It is named after the chief deity of Roman mythology. Jupiter was the first planet to form in the Solar System, influencing the development of other planets. Its atmosphere, composed of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, includes trace amounts of elements like oxygen, carbon, and sulfur, along with compounds such as water vapor and ammonia. Jupiter's rapid rotation (one turn in 10 hours) makes it an oblate spheroid with a noticeable equatorial bulge. The planet generates heat internally, and its structure features a fluid metallic hydrogen mantle and a dense inner core. Its outer atmosphere exhibits turbulent bands and storms, most notably the Great Red Spot, a storm active since at least 1831. Jupiter has the Solar System's strongest magnetic field, generated by its metallic hydrogen core. Its faint ring system, discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979, consists of three segments—the halo, main ring, and gossamer ring—mainly composed of dust particles. The rings have a reddish hue, and their age remains uncertain. Jupiter hosts at least 95 moons, including the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest, is bigger than Mercury. Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes, starting with Pioneer 10 in 1973, with two additional missions currently en route.</p>
